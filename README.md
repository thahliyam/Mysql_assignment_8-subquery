# Mysql_assignment_8-subquery
This project focuses on SQL operations for data management across multiple tables and databases. First, using Country and Persons tables, we perform key operations, such as counting the number of persons in each country and sorting this data in descending order. We also calculate the average ratings of persons by country, displaying only those with an average greater than 3.0. Additionally, using subqueries, we identify countries with the same average rating as the USA. Another query helps us find countries whose populations are above the average population across all nations.

Next, we create a new database, Product, which includes a Customer table. This table is structured with fields for customer information, including ID (as the primary key), name, email, phone number, and address details. Three SQL views are then created for efficient data access: customer_info shows each customer's full name and email, US_Customers filters customers based in the United States, and Customer_details provides a comprehensive view with full name, email, phone number, and state. Additional operations include updating phone numbers for California-based customers, counting customers per state and filtering for states with more than five customers, and sorting customer details by state. This project highlights practical SQL techniques, showcasing the power of views, subqueries, and aggregation functions for organized data management and reporting.
